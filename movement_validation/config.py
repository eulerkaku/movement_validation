Package-level configuration settings. The original Schafer Lab code 
contained many hardcoded values.  These are tracked in a central 
location here.

THIS IS BEING PHASED OUT
- to be replaced with movement_validation/features/feature_processing_options.py

Notes
---------------------------------------
Some hardcoded values were not implemented in this open-source translation.
these are shown here as being commented out.

Usage
---------------------------------------
Best practice is to use this via "from movement_validation import config", 
and then reference the configuration settings like this: e.g. "config.FPS" 
rather than doing " from wormpy.config import * " and referencing "FPS"
since the latter approach pollutes the global namespace.
